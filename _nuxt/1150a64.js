Floccus is not so much a bookmarks<br>\nmanager -- it doesn't give you a managing interface, you can use the browser to sort and cleanup your bookmarks, like you always have.<br>\nFloccus is just a syncing tool: It synchronizes your browser's native bookmarks and gets out of the way.</p>\n<p>For this to work you need a syncing server, a middle man, if you will, that all your devices can access. Floccus currently offers some<br>\nchoice here. The simplest choice is to go and use Google Drive for this. If you don't want Google to know your bookmarks, just encrypt them.</p>\n<p>If you don't have Google Drive or don't want to use it, using WebDAV may be an option. There are many cloud storage services out there that support WebDAV.<br>\nCheckout <a href=\"https://community.cryptomator.org/t/webdav-urls-of-common-cloud-storage-services/75\">this list the Cryptomator Community created</a> to see if your provider offers WebDAV.</p>\n<p>The most enjoyable way to sync is via Nextcloud Bookmarks. Nextcloud is an open source cloud collaboration tool that you can self-host or rent as a service.<br>\nNextcloud offers a multitude of apps to collaborate and share work over, chief amongst them, the Bookmarks app. If you have a Nextcloud installation available,<br>\ntry installing the Bookmarks app and set up floccus to sync with it.
