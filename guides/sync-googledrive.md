1. Create a new profile in the Floccus panel
2. Select Google Drive as your sync method
3. The following screen shows the profile settings.
4. First you will need to connect floccus with your Google account. After clicking “Login with Google”, you will need to sign in and grant floccus access to your Google Drive.
5. The next option allows you to specify the path to your bookmarks file in your Drive storage. By default floccus will place a file called bookmarks.xbel in your topmost folder.
6. If you’d like to encrypt your data before storing it in your Drive, you can set a passphrase here. If you don’t enter anything, it won’t be encrypted.
7. Finally, you can choose which bookmarks folder to sync to that file. By default floccus will create a new folder for you, to avoid syncing something that you don’t want syned. However, with a click on the folder icon you can select any other folder in your bookmarks. Selecting the topmost “untitled” folder will sync everything.
