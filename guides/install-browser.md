| Unlimited web access      | Also sometimes called "read and change data on all websites". Necessary for accessing your self-hosted server. This cannot be limited, because everybody's server has a different URL. Unfortunately, the way webextensions work currently, floccus also gets access to all the data the browser has collected on those websites. However, floccus makes no use of that data and doesn't in any way collect information about you. |
