1. Create a new profile in the Floccus panel
2. Select Nextcloud Bookmarks as your sync method
3. The following screen shows the profile settings.
4. First you will need to enter your nextcloud URL. This should be the url that you use to access your nextcloud, e.g. https://mycloud.provider.com
5. Then enter your username and password. If you want to create a separate app password for floccus, click the button next to the user name field, which will direct you to your Nextcloud instance to approve the generation of an app password.

6. Now, you can configure the folder mapping. You can set one local bookmarks folder and one server folder per profile.

7. Make sure to disable your native browser bookmark sync service, because it is likely incompatible with floccus. (This can cause frequent duplication of bookmarks.)
