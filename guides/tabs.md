Instead of syncing a local bookmarks folder, Floccus can optionally sync your open browser tabs.

1. Create a new account with the sync method of your choice
2. In the account settings, select Tabs instead of a local folder to sync

## Auto-push

You can enable Auto-sync but set sync strategy to "upload & override". This will automatically push your currently open tabs to the server. Whenever you need the tabs on a different browser, or after a crash, you can click download & override once to get the tabs back.

## Manual up- and download

Auto-upload can sometimes cause surprises when you have it enabled on multiple devices or when an empty session is pushed after a browser crash, overriding the previously stored session. This is why you can also turn off auto-sync and up- and download your tabs manually, i.e. when you want to switch to a different device upload your open tabs once on device A and download once on device B â€“ et voila, all your tabs are now on the new device.
