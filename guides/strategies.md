Floccus supports unidirectional, one-way sync as well two-directional “merge” sync.

## Merge
In merge mode, changes from your local browser are merged with changes from other browsers.

## Permanent one-way
Sometimes you want to have one device as a main device and other devices only as listeners. For this scenario you can set the main device to upload & override and all others to download & override to override their changes with the changes from the main device.

## Temporary one-way
Occasionally you only want to temporarily override changes from other devices. For this you can use a one-time upload & override.
In order to undo local changes you can do a one-time download & override to revert all your local changes with the latest server state.
