1. Create a new profile in the Floccus panel
2. Select Git over HTTP as your sync method
3. The following screens show the profile settings.
4. First you will need to enter your Git repository URL and a branch to sync to. Make sure to use the HTTPS URL instead of the SSH URL if you have the choice. Also, make sure that the branch already exists and there are no branch rules that prevent direct commits to the branch.
5. Then enter your username and password for your Git hosting provider. Note that is recommended that you use a device token with read/write access to Content here instead of your actual password and may be a requirement, particularly if you have 2-factor authentication enabled for your account.
6. You can then enter a path and filename for the bookmarks file inside your Git repository. The easiest is to just store it in the root.
7. Finally, you can choose which bookmarks folder to sync to that file. By default floccus will create a new folder for you, to avoid syncing something that you don’t want synced. However, with a click on the folder icon you can select any other folder in your bookmarks. It is not advised anymore to select the topmost folder, because the built-in bookmarks folders are named differently depending on browser vendor and language, and the original attempt to bridge this gap is no longer possible.
8. Make sure to disable your native browser bookmark sync service, because it is likely incompatible with floccus
