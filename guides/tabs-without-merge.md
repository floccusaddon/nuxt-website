If you would like to sync your tabs from different sessions, but don't want to merge them all together, you may like this idea:

Set up one "push" sync profile on each browser that just pushes tabs to the cloud.
Then on each browser set up one profile for each other browser that "pull" syncs the bookmarks of that browser to a folder in the browser bookmarks.

This way you always have access to the tabs of your other devices without merging them.
